This project is a Flask-based web application for predictive maintenance of industrial equipment. It uses a trained machine learning model to detect and classify different types of equipment failures—such as Heat Dissipation Failure, Overstrain Failure, Power Failure, and Tool Wear Failure—based on sensor data inputs like air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear. The system supports both API-based and form-based input methods, enabling real-time fault prediction and visualization through an interactive web interface.
